### general info

BULLAB is a newly founded research group at Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciencess Prague. 

We are exploring the global patterns and evolutionary dynamics of mostly avian traits, alongside their local adaptations. We focus on reproduction, fear, and communication, all tied together by a common thread: biorhythms.

We believe that great science thrives in a collaborative, respectful, and student-centred environment. Our lab is inspired by the inclusive and people-first values advocated by [Fernando Maestre](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006914) and [Joseph Tobias](http://www.tobiaslab.net/values/), and we strive to put these principles into daily practice.

### how we work
- **Non-violent communication**: Respectful, honest, and empathetic communication is the norm. We prioritize listening and understanding over hierarchy or ego.
- **Flat structure & consensus**: We operate with a flat hierarchical structure where decisions are made collectively and unanimously. Everyone’s voice matters.
- **Scientific rigor**: The quality and integrity of our science are paramount. We challenge ideas, not people. 
- **Student-oriented teaching & mentorship**: Our mentorship is fluid and personalized. We begin by asking students what they want to learn and adapt our guidance to best support their growth and interests.
- **Learning mindset & transparency**: We value curiosity, critical thinking, and a willingness to unlearn and relearn. Every challenge is an opportunity to grow—together. We also strive to make our science open and reproducible, to facilitate progress and foster trust, and we are committed to reflecting on how science is practiced and how it can be improved.

### what you can expect of me
- **Non-violent communication, honest & empathy**: I aim to provide honest feedback with empathy, always trying to strike the right balance between critique and encouragement. Your wellbeing matters more than any analysis, paper, report, or proposal.
- [**Blunt editing**](https://x.com/markahix/status/1313163038829109251): I like to be hands-on with manuscripts, making direct changes and suggestions. This is something every strong manuscript goes through—multiple rounds of revision, plenty of ‘red pen,’ and ongoing refinement. If your draft gets marked up, it doesn’t mean it’s worse than others—it just means it's in progress, like all the rest.
- **Fair recognition**: I strive for transparency and fairness in authorship and credit, ensuring contributions are acknowledged appropriately.
- **A safe & supportive environment**: Fostering a supportive, inclusive, and safe workplace is a top priority. If something doesn’t feel right, I want to know.
- **Long-term mentorship**: Whether you stay in academia or not, I want to support your path. I’ll do my best to be a mentor beyond your time in the lab, if that’s what you want.

### what I expect from you
- **Courtesy & respect**: Always treat others with dignity. Our culture is inclusive by design—intolerance has no place here.
- **Honesty & openness**: Whether you're facing a research hurdle or a personal challenge, please just tell me. I’ll do my best to help you solve it. We all make mistakes—I'll demonstrate this for you with surprising regularity. When it's your turn, acknowledge it, correct it if possible, and move on. Addressing small issues early prevents bigger ones down the road. Mistakes are part of growth—owning and addressing them is central to our lab ethos.
- **Independence & initiative**: Be proactive and resourceful. But remember, asking for help is not a weakness—it's part of how we learn.
- **Constructive feedback**: I welcome feedback on how we work together. Communication is a two-way street—our culture is something we co-create.
- **Team spirit**: This is a collective effort. Your contributions help build a supportive and successful lab for all of us.
