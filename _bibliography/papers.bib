   abstract = {Voronoi diagram/ Delaunay triangulation is a basic problem in computational geometry and has been applied in many fields, especially in spatial analysis. This paper presents the ability of constructing Voronoi diagram/ Delaunay triangulation in PostgreSQL/ PostGIS and exploit it to enhance the spatial analysis functions at DBMS level for GIS developers.},
