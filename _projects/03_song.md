We are co-leading a comparative project within which we investigate global patterns and evolution of passerine song. Peter Mikula collected song recordings from open song libraries and extract peak song frequency and song complexity.

We then used the peak song frequency to reveal a lack of support for the acoustic adaptation hypothesis (see <a href='https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13662'>the paper</a> 

Second, we are currently investigating the distribution and drivers of the song complexity of passerines.
